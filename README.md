## About
The river monitoring desktop app allows you to use the Enviorment Agency's river monitoring API to search for your local rivers and check there  current / historical river levels throughout the day. Along with the API it will automatically update every 15 minuites giving you the most up to date reading.

There is also a flood alert system built in which will show you any current flood alerts nearby your chosen river, alongside a map showing the alert area.
